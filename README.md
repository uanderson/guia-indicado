# Guia Indicado

Guia Indicado main goal was provide to people a place where they could find things that normally arenâ€™t easily found, like the best Umuarama raw coffee.

The portal was design to be collaborative, so people could inform places, products or services and the community could moderate the data informed. Also, people could rate every place, product or service, leading the community to provide better products and services.
